A simple kernel module to gain a better understanding of netfilter/packet filtering :

We are trying to write a simple kernel module to

* Gain a better grasp of programming in kernel space.
* Understanding of different protocols.
* Look at options we can provide in firewalls.

This is an experimental project. Use nftables or iptables for serious work.
